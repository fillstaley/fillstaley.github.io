&lt;p>I recently came across a great &lt;a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier">article&lt;/a>
from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
It describes the roles that banks and the Federal Reserve each play in the financial
system, and how these roles have changed in modern times.
The article is aimed at teachers, encouraging educators to update what concepts
they teach in the classroom, but I think it is also useful for making sense of
inconsistencies found in news reporting about the financial system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:21:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>My name is Fill Staley; and welcome to my new website!
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the mathematics department
at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR, USA.
I study partial differential equations with Micah Warren;
but currently I am on leave to recover from burnout.
In stepping away from my research-level mathematics,
I want to return to some of the other things
that I really enjoy learning about and that I feel I have let
wither-on-the-vine at the expense of my graduate pursuits.
Moreover, I want to develope new ways to share what I learn with others.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
