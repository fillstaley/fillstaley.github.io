I am a Ph.D. candidate in the mathematics department
at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR, USA.
I study partial differential equations with Micah Warren;
but currently I am on leave to recover from burnout.
In stepping away from my research-level mathematics,
I want to return to some of the other things
that I really enjoy learning about and that I feel I have let
wither-on-the-vine at the expense of my graduate pursuits.
Moreover, I want to develope new ways to share what I learn with others.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
