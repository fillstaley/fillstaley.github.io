&lt;p>I recently came across a great &lt;a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier">article&lt;/a>
from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
It describes the roles that banks and the Federal Reserve each play in the financial
system, and how these roles have changed in modern times.
The article is aimed at teachers, encouraging educators to update what concepts
they teach in the classroom, but I think it is also useful for making sense of
inconsistencies found in news reporting about the financial system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
